# README

Created in order to fulfil test project for Bravado company. Details of the test - https://github.com/allaud/bravado-quest

Few notices:
1. Usually i use RSpec as the test framework, but as project is just for test, i used native Rails framework MiniTest.
2. I'm not sure that i had choosed right way to highlight text. Maybe i could find something better.

Demo of the project is here - https://still-escarpment-72212.herokuapp.com
